# MyGPT

MyGPT is a free, alternative UI for OpenAI chat models. It uses the same backend model
as ChatGPT. This project is not affiliated with OpenAI.

Use of this project requires a paid OpenAI developer plan and a valid API token.

This project aims to enable savvy users to use a ChatGPT-like product on a pay-per-use
pricing model instead of a monthly subscription. The code is provided without any
warranties, and it is not intended to be run as a public SaaS offering.
