# MyGPT

MyGPT is a free ChatGPT clone powered by the same backend model. Its use requires a
paid OpenAI developer plan and a valid API token.

The intent of this project is to offer end users an option to use a simple
ChatGPT-like product without having to pay for a full ChatGPT Plus subscription plan.

## Setup

1. If you donâ€™t have Node.js installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Node.js version >= 14.6.0 required)

2. Clone this repository

3. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   $ cd mygpt
   ```

4. Install the requirements

   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```

5. Make a copy of the example environment variables file

   On Linux systems:

   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

   On Windows:

   ```powershell
   $ copy .env.example .env
   ```

6. Add your [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `.env` file

7. Run the app

   ```bash
   $ npm run dev
   ```

You should now be able to access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!
